## Equipment

In adition to the raspberry pi itself and the sd card, case, etc. This is the equipment that I used

- Breadboard and jumper wires: <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KGQHJW8/>
- 5v Power Supply: <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BZL1G6DS/>
- Addressable lights: <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018X04ES2/>
- Jumper wires: <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GJSPF7P>
- SN74LS245N Octal Bus Transcievers: <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YXDBHX9>
- Breadboard power supply: <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IUYLVFK>

The power supply may have done the power reduction for me, but I tried to follow the intructions.
